# Movie Rating Analysis using Python

This project aims to analyze movie ratings using Python. The goal is to gain insights into movie ratings and understand patterns or trends that may exist in the data. The project utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on a dataset containing movie ratings. The dataset includes information such as movie titles, genres, user ratings, and other relevant attributes. The dataset can be obtained from [source link].

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-rating-analysis.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd movie-rating-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main analysis script:

   ```bash
   python movie_analysis.py
   ```

2. The script will load the movie ratings dataset, perform various analysis tasks, and generate visualizations.

3. Explore the generated visualizations to gain insights into movie ratings and related patterns.

## Customization

You can customize the analysis according to your specific requirements. Here are a few ways you can modify the project:

- **Dataset**: Replace the provided movie ratings dataset with your own dataset. Ensure that the new dataset has the necessary attributes for movie ratings analysis.

- **Analysis Tasks**: Modify the analysis tasks in the `movie_analysis.py` script to focus on specific aspects of movie ratings. Add or remove analysis steps based on your interests and goals.

- **Visualization**: Customize the visualizations generated by modifying the plotting code in the `movie_analysis.py` script. You can adjust colors, labels, titles, and other visual elements to suit your preferences.
